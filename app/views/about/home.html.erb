<p>The African Poetry Digital Portal, in collaboration with the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities at the University of Nebraska, is the newest project of the African Poetry Book Fund. The Portal is an ongoing project and will be a gateway, providing access to and details of digital and print book manuscripts, newspapers and periodicals, newsletters, audio recordings, video recordings, websites, and related collections of African poetry written by Africans from antiquity to the present. It will also feature curated digital projects on various aspects of African poetry. The philosophical basis of this entire project is predicated on the understanding that there is a rich store of creative and intellectual resources in Africa and its Diaspora related to African poetry and poetics that can be transformative and influential in the world. This project is also predicated on the belief that while such resources exist, they have not been effectively organized around African Poetry and poetics in a manner that allows them to galvanize research to influence intellectual engagement with poetics around the world, and to add significantly to our understanding of poetics in Africa and the global world. The purpose of the project is to engage and connect scholars, thinkers, artists, and communities around the world who will benefit from a free and thoughtful exchange of ideas and study around African Poetry.</p>

<p>These first two sites of the portal were supported by a grant from the Ford Foundation and consist of the first section of the Index for Contemporary African Poets and a project titled <em>A survey of African Poetry in the London Times, Sunday Times, Financial Times, and the Times Literary Supplement 1865-1985</em> the first project of the African Poets and Poetry in the News site. </p>
