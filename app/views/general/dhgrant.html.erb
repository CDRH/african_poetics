<h2>Project Abstract</h2>
<p>“Network Poetics: The Big World of African Little Magazines” examines African little magazines and turn the names, locations, and works of the poets, artists, and writers into metadata. This metadata will then be visualized through a network model to highlight the expansive nature of African little magazines. By visualizing the data, this project aims to examine how poetry took flight beyond the specificity of regionalism through the vehicle of the little magazine. In so doing, we aim to highlight the ways in which print culture has been a driving force for Black literary practices on the continent and throughout the diaspora. Researchers and users of the network model will be able to manipulate the visuals in order to answer key questions regarding national identity, language, translation, gender, and cultural themes that arise in the study of little magazines.</p>
